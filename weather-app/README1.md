# Weather App P1 

## Create a weather app!

* Use the webpack prototype as the base of your project (the application that was covered on Wednesday as a class). 
* Create the UI for your weather app. Make sure that users can input a city name. 
* Use fetch to make your weather app work for, at least, the city "Berlin".
