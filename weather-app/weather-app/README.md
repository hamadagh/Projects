# Weather API 

## Create a weather app using HTML, CSS and JavaScript!

* The user should be able to type in a city name and receive information about the weather of that city for the next few days. 
* Create a token in OpenWeather in order to get access to the API. 

### Project Architecture

* The project will use modules for functionality that will be imported to your main js file. 

#### Structure the project as following: 
* In the main js file, you should store the functionality of what the user is searching in the weather app's input field. You should create a function to fetch the api's data and get the weather of the week.
* In another file, create a function which gets the hour, minute and day to display to the user. 
* You should have another file which displays the rest of weather data to the user. 

**Bonus** Create a toggle which allows users to display data in either Celcius or Fahrenheit. Create another file to store these functions.


**Do not forget to import and export your files to the appropriate locations.**

### Rules 
* This is an individual assignment.
